## Course Description

In this course, we’ll build and deploy a polished, production-ready app for discovering video games. This app includes all the modern features you’d expect, like light and dark mode toggling, game search, filtering, sorting, and loading skeletons. By the end, you’ll have a professional-grade app that showcases the power and flexibility of React. Get a sneak peek of this app in the course trailer video on this page.
